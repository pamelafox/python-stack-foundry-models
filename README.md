# Python Stack for Foundry Models

This repository contains samples showing different Python stacks for building on top of multiple [Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/) models (OpenAI, Claude, etc). Each example demonstrates the same task — calling a Foundry-hosted model — using a different Python SDK or framework.

## Getting started

You have a few options for getting started with this repository.
The quickest way to get started is GitHub Codespaces, since it will setup everything for you, but you can also [set it up locally](#local-environment).

### GitHub Codespaces

You can run this repository virtually by using GitHub Codespaces. The button will open a web-based VS Code instance in your browser:

1. Open the repository (this may take several minutes):

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/pamelafox/python-stack-foundry-models)

2. Open a terminal window
3. Continue with the steps to run the examples

### VS Code Dev Containers

A related option is VS Code Dev Containers, which will open the project in your local VS Code using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):

1. Start Docker Desktop (install it if not already installed)
2. Open the project:

    [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/pamelafox/python-stack-foundry-models)

3. In the VS Code window that opens, once the project files show up (this may take several minutes), open a terminal window.
4. Continue with the steps to run the examples

### Local environment

1. Make sure the following tools are installed:

    * [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
    * Git

2. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/pamelafox/python-stack-foundry-models
    cd python-stack-foundry-models
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```shell
    uv sync
    ```

## Deploying Foundry models

All examples use models hosted on [Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/). The project includes infrastructure as code (IaC) to provision OpenAI and Claude deployments. The IaC is defined in the `infra` directory and uses the Azure Developer CLI to provision the resources.

1. Make sure the [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd) is installed.

2. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

    For GitHub Codespaces users, if the previous command fails, try:

   ```shell
    azd auth login --use-device-code
    ```

    If you are using a tenant besides the default tenant, you may need to also login with Azure CLI to that tenant:

    ```shell
    az login --tenant your-tenant-id
    ```

3. Provision the Foundry resources:

    ```shell
    azd provision
    ```

    It will prompt you to provide an `azd` environment name (like "stack-demos"), select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a location. Then it will provision the resources in your account.

4. Once the resources are provisioned, you should now see a local `.env` file with all the environment variables needed to run the scripts.
5. To delete the resources, run:

    ```shell
    azd down
    ```

## Running the Python examples

You can run the examples in this repository by executing the scripts in the `examples` directory. Each example demonstrates calling Foundry models using a different Python stack.

| Example | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [openai_responses.py](examples/openai_responses.py) | Calling a Foundry-hosted OpenAI model using the OpenAI Python SDK (Responses API). |
| [anthropic_messages.py](examples/anthropic_messages.py) | Calling a Foundry-hosted Claude model using the Anthropic Python SDK (Messages API). |
| [litellm_swap.py](examples/litellm_swap.py) | Calling either OpenAI or Claude models via LiteLLM, a unified interface that abstracts provider differences. |
| [pydanticai_agent.py](examples/pydanticai_agent.py) | Building an agent with tools using PydanticAI, configured for either OpenAI or Claude on Foundry. |
| [langchain_agent.py](examples/langchain_agent.py) | Building an agent with tools using LangChain, configured for either OpenAI or Claude on Foundry. |
| [agentframework_agent.py](examples/agentframework_agent.py) | Building an agent with tools using Microsoft Agent Framework, configured for either OpenAI or Claude on Foundry. |

Run any example with:

```shell
uv run examples/<example_name>.py
```
